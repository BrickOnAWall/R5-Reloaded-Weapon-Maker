# R5-Reloaded-Weapon-Maker

A simple project made by justanotheruser. Focus on quick designing of weapons and makes it as easy as possible. 
Ensure that you have selected your game folder via the settings. I hope you enjoy my 48 hours of effort in which I painfully encountered python errors :)




This was just a quick simple project so don't be suprised if this version is unstable.




If you have any errors you most likely don't have path on Python, or your install is shit. I would recommend watching a youtube guide on it so here's one that worked for me.
Also if you have any errors first delete python and redownload it.
